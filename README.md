# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to my portfolio website! This is where I showcase my skills, experience, and projects as a web developer. 

## About the Project
This portfolio is a personal website that highlights my abilities in front-end development, featuring projects that I have worked on. The website is built using the following technologies:

- HTML: The backbone of the website structure.
- CSS: Styling the layout and design.
- TailwindCSS: Utility-first CSS framework to design the website efficiently.
- JavaScript: To bring interactivity to the page.
- ReactJS: For building dynamic user interfaces.
- Framer Motion: For smooth animations and transitions across the website.

The website showcases projects I have worked on in front-end development, highlighting my skills in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.

## Key Features
- Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and works well across desktop and mobile devices.
- Smooth Animations: Iâ€™ve used Framer Motion and GSAP for smooth, engaging animations that make the user experience more interactive.
- Interactive Projects: The projects section showcases three projects that you can interact with. Each project has its own details and features to explore.
